# OSVirtualLab
We made Operating System Virtual Lab where students are able to learn CPU Scheduling Algorithms from scratch and also implement Algorithms in this website. Here we also provide animated video for clearing basic ideas. And for deep understanding also various blogs and tutorials are available.

## Section Of Operating System Virtual Lab 
*   Disk Scheduling 
*   Page Replacement 
*   Deadlock & Concurrency
*   CPU Scheduling 

### Out of this four Section our team made CPU Scheduling Algorithms.  
### And Our Senior made Page Replacement Algorithms and Disk Scheduling Algorithms.
